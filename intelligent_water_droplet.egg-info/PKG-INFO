Description: ## Intelligent Water Drops Algorithm
        
        A natural river often finds good paths among lots of possible paths in its ways from
        the source to destination. These near optimal or optimal paths are obtained by the actions and
        reactions that occur among the water drops and the water drops with the riverbeds. The intelligent
        water drops (IWD) algorithm is a new swarm-based optimisation algorithm inspired from
        observing natural water drops that flow in rivers. In this paper, the IWD algorithm is tested to
        find solutions of the n-queen puzzle with a simple local heuristic. The travelling salesman
        problem (TSP) is also solved with a modified IWD algorithm. Moreover, the IWD algorithm is
        tested with some more multiple knapsack problems (MKP) in which near-optimal or optimal
        solutions are obtained.
